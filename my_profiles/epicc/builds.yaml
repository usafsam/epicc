# This is where we define which builds we'd like to run.
# This example includes 4 separate builds, ranging from the regional (global) to location (county) level.
# You can comment-out, remove, or add as many builds as you'd like.

# Each build needs a name, a defined subsampling process, and geographic attributes used for subsampling.
# Geography is specified by build attributes (e.g., `region`, `country`, `division`, `location`) that are referenced from subsampling schemes.

# The default config file, `./defaults/parameters.yaml` has reasonable default subsampling methods for each geographic resolution.
# These subsample primarily from the area of interest ("focus"), and add in background ("contextual") sequences from the rest of the world.
# Contextual sequences that are genetically similar to (hamming distance) and geographically near the focal sequences are heavily prioritized.

# In this example, we use these default methods. See other templates for examples of how to customize this subsampling scheme.

builds:
  epicc: # name of the build; this can be anything
    subsampling_scheme: epicc-only # use a custom subsampling scheme defined below
    region: North America
    country: USA

# Define custom subsampling logic for county-level builds.
subsampling:
  epicc-only:
    # Focal samples for location
    focal:
      group_by: "originating_lab"
      seq_per_group: 300
      # Use augur filter's query argument to filter strains with pandas-style logic expressions.
      # This can be easier to read than the corresponding filter by exclusion.
      query: --query "(originating_lab == 'usafsam')"

    # Samples that are genetically related to the focal samples
    related:
      group_by: "country year month"
      seq_per_group: 20
#      exclude: "--exclude-where 'location={location}'"
      priorities:

# Here, you can specify what type of auspice_config you want to use
# and what description you want. These will apply to all the above builds.
# If you want to specify specific files for each build - you can!
# See the 'example_advanced_customization' builds.yaml
